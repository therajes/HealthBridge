# MediCall: Telemedicine Platform for Rural Healthcare Access

## Abstract

MediCall is a comprehensive telemedicine platform designed to address critical healthcare accessibility challenges in rural regions, with initial deployment targeting Nabha and its surrounding 173 villages in Punjab, India. The platform leverages modern web technologies to provide remote medical consultations, digital health records, pharmacy inventory management, and AI-powered symptom assessment, optimized for low-bandwidth rural environments.

## Problem Statement

### Healthcare Infrastructure Challenges

The rural healthcare system in Nabha faces severe operational constraints that directly impact patient outcomes and community well-being:

- **Critical Staffing Shortages**: The local Civil Hospital operates with only 11 doctors against 23 sanctioned positions, representing a 52% vacancy rate
- **Geographic Accessibility Issues**: Patients from 173 surrounding villages must undertake extensive travel, often resulting in lost work hours and income
- **Resource Limitations**: Frequent unavailability of medical specialists and consistent medicine stockouts
- **Infrastructure Deficiencies**: Poor road conditions and inadequate sanitation facilities exacerbate access challenges

### Socioeconomic Impact

These healthcare barriers disproportionately affect vulnerable populations:

- **Daily-wage Workers**: Income loss due to medical travel creates significant financial strain
- **Agricultural Communities**: Farmers face productivity losses when seeking medical care
- **Preventable Complications**: Delayed treatment leads to worsening of otherwise manageable conditions
- **Community Well-being**: Overall decline in rural health outcomes and quality of life

## Solution Overview
